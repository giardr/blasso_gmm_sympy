# BLASSO for GMM with diagonal covariances

We provide the notebook associated with the paper ``Gaussian Mixture Model with unknown diagonal covariances via continuous sparse regularization'', by Romane Giard, Yohann De Castro and Cl√©ment Marteau. 
We check calculations using symbolic computation with [SymPy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html).
